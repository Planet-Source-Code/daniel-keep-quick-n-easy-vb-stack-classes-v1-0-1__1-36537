<center><h1>Visual Basic Stacks</h1>v1.0 Readme</center>
<hr />
<br />

Ok, I suppose I should actually write how to use these things, so yeah. ;)<br />
<br />
Let's start with a basic example of using each stack.  This is actually really, really
easy :o<br />
<br />
First up, dump the three stack classes CStringStack, CLongStack and CStack into a project.
Now, find somewhere in your code to add some dummy code (just for demonstration purposes,
like maybe on a command button or something).  Put the following in:<br />
<br />
<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">
Dim sstkTemp As CStringStack<br />
Dim lstkTemp As CLongStack<br />
Dim stkTemp As CStack<br />
<br />
Set sstkTemp = New CStringStack<br />
Set lstkTemp = New CLongStack<br />
Set stkTemp = New CStack<br />
<br />
</font>
Now that's how you create your stacks.  To use them, since they all use the same methods,
I'll juse use the long stack.<br />
<br />
<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">
With lstkTemp<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;.Push h1543&amp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;.Push hA632&amp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;.Push h24FF&amp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;' We just 'pushed' three numbers onto the stack.  Now, let's pop them off,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;' debugging the output as we go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Debug.Print .Pop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Debug.Print .Pop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Debug.Print .Pop<br />
End With<br />
<br />
</font>
The above code would generate the following in the Immediate window:<br />
<br />
<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">
5443<br />
42546<br />
9471<br />
<br />
</font>
The only other thing you need to know about is the CStringStack.DumpStack() method.  It
takes a delimiter as an argument, and dumps the entire stack from bottom to top.  For
example, a stack with the following pushed on (in that order): "C:", "WINNT", "SYSTEM"
that had the following call made: DumpStack("\") would return:<br />
<br />
<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">
C:\WINNT\SYSTEM<br />
<br />
</font>
Well, that's it for this really crappy readme.  Sorry, but I'm feeling lazy right now ;)<br />
