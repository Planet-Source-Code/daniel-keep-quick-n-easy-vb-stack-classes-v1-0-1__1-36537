## Quick'n'Easy VB Stack Classes v1\.0\.1


</div>

### Description

(Minor Update to 1.0.1) Well, this is my first PSC submission, so yay.

These two classes simply implement nice, neat little stacks: CStringStack and CLongStack.

I've found that these things can be invaluable in a variety of tasks. I actually wrote the string stack originally to maintain a call stack for a scripting language.

They are VERY easy to modify to accept any given data format. One thing I forgot to do was create a Variant-based stack, although if enough people request one, I'll knock it together and upload it for completeness.

Update: I changed some of the documentation (and added a readme) to clear up some problems people had been having.
